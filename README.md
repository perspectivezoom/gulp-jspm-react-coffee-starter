## Acknowledgements

Large portions of this repo were more or less copied from:

* [Glen Maddern's post and screencast](http://glenmaddern.com/articles/javascript-in-2015), for explaining [JSPM](http://jspm.io) and how it might be better than [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) as it need not pre-compile.
* [Gulp Starter](https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter), for showing how to split tasks across files, and for most of the tasks.
* [This post](http://demisx.github.io/gulp4/2015/01/15/install-gulp4.html) to get Gulp 4 working and take advantage of `gulp.series` and `gulp.parallel`
* [This post](http://pem-musing.blogspot.com/2014/02/a-gulp-of-coffee-your-gulpfile-in.html) to get coffeescript Gulp tasks working
* [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)
* [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
